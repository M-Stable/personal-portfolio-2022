# Personal Portfolio V2

live site: https://www.francislee.cf/

Hi! My name is Francis and this is my second personal portfolio I've built (hopefully an upgrade from the previous one).  
I built this website with React and decided to use tailwind css for the first time. I heard a lot about it and always wanted to give it a go, so I used this as an opportunity to learn a new skill. I also learnt gsap for all the animations you see on the page. It was very challenging but I got the hang of it towards the end. 

I also played around with three js and got some models imported in previous iterations, but ultimately decided that it didn't feel 'natural' in this website. This is the longest I've spent on a personal project as I wanted to make sure the design was something I was really proud of. I spent countless hours on Figma, where I would rearrange elements and try countless fonts.

Some details in the portfolio I would like to point out are the custom cursor, progress scrollbar, videos playing only when in view, custom logo, and the subtle scrolling animations. Hope you enjoy!
